# SCR Project Reorganization Summary

## Overview of Changes

The Sorcery: Contested Realm (SCR) deck building system project has been reorganized from a flat structure to a properly organized directory structure. This document summarizes the changes made.

## Directory Structure

Created a logical directory structure:
```
.
├── src/                      # Source code
│   ├── analyses/             # Analysis modules
│   │   ├── playability/      # Deck playability analysis
│   │   ├── position/         # Position-based analysis 
│   │   └── synergy/          # Card synergy analysis
│   ├── core/                 # Core functionality
│   │   ├── cards/            # Card-related functionality
│   │   ├── deck/             # Deck construction and validation

│   │   └── rules/            # Game rules and enforcement
│   ├── data/                 # Data files and processing
│   │   ├── processed/        # Processed card data

│   ├── optimization/         # Performance optimizations
│   ├── tests/                # Test scripts
│   ├── tools/                # Utility tools
│   └── utils/                # Common utility functions
└── scripts/                  # Convenience scripts for users
```

## File Organization

Files were organized into directories based on their function:

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Deck building: deckBuilder.js, deckOptimizer.js, deckExporter.js, deckValidator.js
   - Card management: cardAnalysis.js, cardCombos.js
   - Rules: ruleEnforcer.js, rules.txt

2. **Analysis Modules**:
   - Synergy: synergyCalculator.js, deckStats.js
   - Playability: deckPlayability.js
   - Position: elementRequirementAnalyzer.js, siteSelector.js

3. **Data Management**:
   - Raw data: CSV files
   - Processed data: sorceryCards.js, processCards.js

4. **Utilities**:
   - General utilities: utils.js
   - Optimization: optimized versions of core files

## Additional Improvements

1. **User Experience**:
   - Added convenience scripts in `/scripts/` for easier access
   - Created a package.json with npm scripts
   - Added a top-level index.js file for direct execution

2. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README.md with the new structure
   - Created this summary document
   - Organized existing documentation in `/src/docs/`

3. **Development Tools**:
   - Updated switch-system.sh to work with the new structure
   - Added test-imports.js to verify correct imports
   - Created .gitignore for better source control

## Next Steps

To complete the reorganization:

1. Run the import test script to identify any remaining issues:
   ```
   npm run test:imports
   ```

2. Test core functionality with the build-deck script:
   ```
   npm run build-deck -- --element Water
   ```

3. Further optimize the codebase based on this organization
