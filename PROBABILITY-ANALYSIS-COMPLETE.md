## ðŸ›  Implementation Details

### Core Classes and Methods

#### `BrowserDeckBuilder` Class Extensions

**Enhanced `buildDeck()` Method**
```typescript
async buildDeck(options: {
  preferredElements?: Element[];
  preferredElement?: Element;
  archetype?: string;
  avatar?: string;
  includeProbabilityAnalysis?: boolean;
}): Promise<EnhancedDeckResult>
```

**New Analysis Methods**
- `getDeckAnalysis()` - Comprehensive deck evaluation
- `calculateMatchupProbabilities()` - Archetype-specific win rate analysis
- `getOptimizationSuggestions()` - Actionable improvement recommendations

### Mathematical Foundations

#### Hypergeometric Distribution
The system uses proper hypergeometric distribution calculations to determine the probability of drawing specific cards:

```
P(X = k) = C(K,k) * C(N-K,n-k) / C(N,n)
```

Where:
- N = total deck size (50 cards)
- K = number of copies of target card
- n = hand size (7 + draws)
- k = number of target cards drawn

#### Consistency Scoring Algorithm
The consistency score combines multiple factors:
1. **Early Game Availability** (30% weight) - Probability of drawing 1-2 mana cards
2. **Mana Curve Distribution** (40% weight) - How well the curve matches optimal patterns
3. **Card Redundancy** (30% weight) - Presence of multiple cards with similar effects

## ðŸ“ˆ Usage Examples

### Basic Probability Analysis
```javascript
const deckBuilder = new BrowserDeckBuilder();

const result = await deckBuilder.buildDeck({
  preferredElement: Element.Water,
  archetype: 'Midrange',
  includeProbabilityAnalysis: true
});

console.log(`Consistency Score: ${result.probabilityAnalysis.consistencyScore}%`);
console.log(`Meta Position: ${result.metaAnalysis.metaPosition}`);
```

### Detailed Analysis
```javascript
const analysis = await deckBuilder.getDeckAnalysis(deck, avatar);

console.log('Strengths:', analysis.strengths);
console.log('Weaknesses:', analysis.weaknesses);
console.log('Recommendations:', analysis.recommendations);
```

### Matchup Analysis
```javascript
const matchups = await deckBuilder.calculateMatchupProbabilities(deck, avatar);

Object.entries(matchups).forEach(([archetype, data]) => {
  console.log(`vs ${archetype}: ${data.winRate}% win rate`);
});
```

### Optimization Suggestions
```javascript
const optimizations = await deckBuilder.getOptimizationSuggestions(deck, avatar, 'Midrange');

console.log(`Overall Score: ${optimizations.overallScore}%`);
console.log('Priority Changes:', optimizations.priorityChanges);
```

## ðŸŽ² Probability Calculations Explained

### Turn-by-Turn Analysis
The system calculates draw probabilities for key game turns:

- **Turn 1**: 7-card opening hand probability
- **Turn 3**: 9-card probability (hand + 2 draws)
- **Turn 5**: 11-card probability (hand + 4 draws)  
- **Turn 7**: 13-card probability (hand + 6 draws)

### Key Metrics

#### Consistency Score (0-100)
- **80-100**: Highly consistent, reliable performance
- **60-79**: Good consistency with minor issues
- **40-59**: Moderate consistency, needs improvement
- **0-39**: Poor consistency, major restructuring needed

#### Meta Position
- **Strong**: Well-positioned against current meta trends
- **Viable**: Competitive but requires skilled play
- **Weak**: Struggles in current meta environment
