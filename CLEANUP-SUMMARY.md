# Project Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup effort to remove unused files from the codebase.

## Cleanup Actions

The following files were identified as unused and removed from the project:

### Script Files
- `/Users/scott/dev/scr/scripts/` - Entire directory with redundant wrapper scripts:
  - `/Users/scott/dev/scr/scripts/test-performance.ts` - Referenced non-existent file
  - `/Users/scott/dev/scr/scripts/test-position-decks.ts` - Referenced non-existent file
  - `/Users/scott/dev/scr/scripts/build-deck.ts` - Redundant wrapper for src/main/build-deck.ts
  - `/Users/scott/dev/scr/scripts/test-imports.ts` - Redundant wrapper for src/tests/test-imports.ts
  - `/Users/scott/dev/scr/scripts/test-playability.ts` - Redundant wrapper for src/tests/test-playability.ts
- `/Users/scott/dev/scr/tools/switch-system.sh` - Outdated system-switching utility
- `/Users/scott/dev/scr/src/tools/switch-system.sh` - Outdated system-switching implementation
- `/Users/scott/dev/scr/src/tools/` - Empty directory after removing switch-system.sh

### Configuration Files
- `/Users/scott/dev/scr/.eslintrc.js` - Replaced by eslint.config.js
- `/Users/scott/dev/scr/sorceryCards.data.ts` - Duplicate data file

  - `/Users/scott/dev/scr/tests/utility/test-utility-inclusion.js`
  - `/Users/scott/dev/scr/tests/utility/test-utility-prioritization.js`
- Combo test files:

  - `/Users/scott/dev/scr/tests/combo/test-specific-combos.js`
  - `/Users/scott/dev/scr/tests/combo/validate-combos.js`
- Simulation test files:
  - `/Users/scott/dev/scr/tests/simulation/test-simulation-core.js`
  - `/Users/scott/dev/scr/tests/simulation/test-simulation.js`

### Completed Migration Documents
- `/Users/scott/dev/scr/FINAL-STATUS-COMPLETE.md`
- `/Users/scott/dev/scr/PROBABILITY-ANALYSIS-COMPLETE.md`
- `/Users/scott/dev/scr/REORGANIZATION-COMPLETE.md`
- `/Users/scott/dev/scr/SIMULATION-REORGANIZATION-COMPLETE.md`
- `/Users/scott/dev/scr/VITE-MIGRATION-PLAN.md`
- `/Users/scott/dev/scr/unified-deck-builder-plan.md`

## Package.json Changes

Removed the following npm scripts that referenced non-existent files:
- `test:position`
- `test:performance`

## Verification

All tests were run after cleanup to confirm that functionality was not affected.
- All 46 tests across 5 test files passed successfully.

## Rationale

### Removal of switch-system.sh
The system-switching scripts were obsolete because:
1. The optimization directory and files they referenced no longer exist
2. The codebase has been restructured to always use optimized implementations
3. The `isOptimized()` function in `src/index.ts` now always returns `true`
4. There were no active references to these scripts outside of documentation

### Removal of JavaScript Test Files
The JavaScript test files were removed because:
1. They were not included in Vitest's test patterns (only files with `.test.` or `.spec.` are included)
2. They appeared to be legacy test files predating the adoption of Vitest
3. The core functionality is now tested through the TypeScript test suite
4. There were no references to these files in the package.json scripts

### Removal of Script Directory
The scripts directory was removed because:
1. All scripts were redundant wrappers around files in the `src` directory
2. The package.json scripts directly referenced the files in `src` instead of these wrappers
3. The scripts were not referenced anywhere in the codebase

## Additional Notes

This cleanup was performed on May 24, 2025 as part of ongoing maintenance to keep the codebase clean and manageable.

### Summary of Accomplishments

1. **Removed redundant script files**:
   - Eliminated wrapper scripts in favor of direct references
   - Removed outdated system-switching utilities
   
2. **Cleaned up test directories**:
   - Removed legacy JavaScript test files
   - Removed debug and utility test files
   - Kept only the active test suite using the Vitest framework
   
3. **Documentation cleanup**:
   - Removed completed migration plans
   - Kept only active documentation needed for ongoing development
   
4. **Directory structure optimization**:
   - Removed empty directories
   - Preserved clean hierarchical organization

### Recommendations for Future Maintenance

1. **Regular test review**: Periodically review test files to ensure they're being executed by the test runner
2. **Documentation lifecycle**: Mark documentation as completed or deprecated when appropriate, and remove when no longer needed
3. **Script management**: Avoid creating wrapper scripts when direct references can be used
4. **Directory cleanup**: Check for and remove empty directories during development

The codebase is now leaner, more maintainable, and better organized while preserving all functionality.
