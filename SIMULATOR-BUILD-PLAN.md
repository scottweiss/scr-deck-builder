- **Game Engine**: TypeScript with modular architecture
- **Build System**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit and integration tests
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with CSS Custom Properties

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Modular Game Engine
```typescript
// Core engine interface
interface GameEngine {
  readonly state: GameState;
  readonly turnEngine: TurnEngine;
  readonly combatSystem: CombatSystem;
  readonly aiEngine: AIEngine;
  
  executeAction(action: GameAction): ActionResult;
  simulateToEnd(): GameResult;
  getValidActions(): GameAction[];
}
```

#### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
```typescript
// Game events for UI synchronization
interface GameEvent {
  type: GameEventType;
  playerId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  data: any;
}

// Event types
enum GameEventType {
  CARD_PLAYED,
  UNIT_MOVED,
  COMBAT_DECLARED,
  EFFECT_TRIGGERED,
  TURN_ENDED
}
```

#### 3. State Management
```typescript
// Immutable game state
interface GameState {
  readonly gameId: string;
  readonly turn: number;
  readonly phase: GamePhase;
  readonly activePlayer: string;
  readonly players: ReadonlyMap<string, PlayerState>;
  readonly board: BoardState;
  readonly stack: ActionStack;
}
```

### Performance Requirements
