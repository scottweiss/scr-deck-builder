# SCR Deck Building System Enhancement - May 2025 Update

This update enhances the Sorcery: Contested Realm deck building system with improved handling of position-based interactions and elemental thresholds/requirements.

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Position-Based Interactions
- Added detailed positional profiles for cards (underground, underwater, airborne, standard, region)
- Implemented sophisticated positional synergy calculations that consider:
  - Shared positioning between cards (cards operating in the same battlefield zone)
  - Position control interactions (cards that target specific positions)
  - Position enhancement synergies (cards that buff others in the same position)
  - Position blocking anti-synergies (cards that block positions your own cards use)
  - Advanced regional control mechanics
  - Grid/adjacency-based targeting mechanics

### 2. Element Requirement Analysis System
- Added analysis of elemental thresholds required by cards
- Implemented detection of element deficiencies in decks
- Added scoring for how well cards address elemental deficiencies
- Enhanced card selection to prioritize fixing elemental requirements

### 3. New Position-Based Combo Detection
- Added Multi-Position Mastery combo detection
- Added Underground Network System combo detection
- Added Water Dominance Engine combo detection
- Added Aerial Superiority Chamber combo detection
- Added Positional Control System combo detection
- Added Elemental Convergence combo detection
- Added Elemental Threshold Payoffs combo detection

### 4. Improved Deck Optimization
- Enhanced mana curve optimization based on positional strategy
- Added elemental contribution scoring to card selection criteria
- Improved weighting of elements based on card impact
- Enhanced synergy calculations for positional strategies

## Testing

The new test-position-decks.js file demonstrates how the system builds decks focused on different position-based strategies:
- Underground strategy deck focuses on burrowing and underground movement
- Underwater strategy deck focuses on submerge mechanics and water control
- Airborne strategy deck focuses on flying units and air superiority

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
1. AI-based predictive modeling of position-based matchups
2. Dynamic adjustment of position distribution based on meta analysis
3. Card recommendation engine specifically for elemental threshold requirements
4. Integration with user-defined position priorities and preferences
