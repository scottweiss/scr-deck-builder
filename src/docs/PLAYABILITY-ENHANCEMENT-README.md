# SCR Deck Building System - Playability Enhancement

This update enhances the Sorcery: Contested Realm deck building system with an emphasis on ensuring deck playability rather than focusing solely on mana curve theorycrafting.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Playability-First Approach
- **Critical Card Counts**: Ensures minimum playable cards at each mana value
- **Early Game Focus**: Prioritizes having sufficient early game plays (turns 1-3)
- **Flexible Card Selection**: Considers cards with card draw, filtering, or cost reduction as alternatives for early plays
- **Conservative Adjustments**: Makes more conservative deck adjustments to avoid disrupting synergies

### 2. New Deck Playability Analyzer
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Evaluates multiple factors that contribute to deck playability
- **Issue Detection**: Identifies specific playability issues in the deck
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests specific cards to address playability concerns
- **Playability Score**: Calculates an overall playability score from 0-10

### 3. Analysis Factors
- **Early Game Presence**: Cards for turns 1-3
- **Mid Game Coverage**: Cards for turns 4-6
- **Card Advantage**: Card draw, search, and filtering effects
- **Mana Acceleration**: Ability to accelerate into high-cost cards
- **Interaction**: Ability to interact with opponent's threats
- **Win Conditions**: Clear paths to victory
- **Positional Consistency**: Coherent positional strategy
- **Elemental Consistency**: Proper elemental distribution

### 4. Enhanced Mana Curve Logic
- Focuses on ensuring playable cards at each mana value rather than strictly adhering to theoretical curves
- Prevents over-pruning of cards at any given mana cost
- Preserves combo pieces and synergistic cards regardless of mana curve considerations
- Prioritizes early-game playability when making deck adjustments

### 5. Card Selection Criteria Updates
- Enhanced card evaluation to prioritize playability
- Added specific handling for card advantage effects
- Added flexible card consideration for critical mana points with few options
- Improved scoring for cards that generate resources or provide flexibility

## Practical Benefits

1. **More Consistent Draws**: Decks will more reliably have playable cards each turn
2. **Better Early Game**: Improved focus on the critical early turns
3. **Resource Balancing**: Better balance of card advantage and mana production
4. **Smarter Card Choices**: Cards selected based on overall utility rather than just mana cost
5. **Detailed Feedback**: More actionable feedback about deck construction issues

## Technical Implementation

- Added new `deckPlayability.js` module for dedicated playability analysis
- Enhanced `deckOptimizer.js` with playability-focused card selection
- Integrated playability analysis into the main deck building process
- Added detailed console output to highlight playability concerns and recommendations
- Extended deck builder return values to include playability metrics

## Future Improvements

1. **Interactive Recommendations**: Allow users to accept specific card recommendations
2. **Matchup-Based Analysis**: Adjust playability recommendations based on expected meta
3. **Learning System**: Improve recommendations based on deck performance data
4. **Contextual Card Evaluation**: Better understand card roles in specific strategies
5. **Opening Hand Simulation**: Calculate probability of playable opening hands
